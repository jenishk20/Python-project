# Diabetes Prediction/Recommendation System

### --->Recommender systems use algorithms to provide users with product or service recommendations. Recently, these systems have been using machine learning algorithms from the field of artificial intelligence. An increasing number of online companies are utilizing recommendation systems to increase user interaction and enrich shopping potential. Use cases of recommendation systems have been expanding rapidly. They across many aspects of eCommerce and online media, and we expect this trend to continue.

### --->Recommendations can be made on the basis of supervised learning priciple of Machine Learning wherein we give Dataset along with Outcome to the system and then test the system's accuracy based upon test set.

## 1. GENERAL ALGORITHMS FOR PREDICTION OF DIABETES ARE :

##      1.1 KNN ALGORITHM ( K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ALGORITHM ):-

###     KNN Algorithm finds out the k most nearest neighbour of the test data with respect to the traindata and then evaluates the outcome 

##      1.2 LOGISTIC REGRESSSION :-

###     Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary) Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.  

##      1.3 DECISION TREE :-

##      1.4 RANDOM FOREST :-

##      1.5 NAIVE BAYES :-

##      1.6 SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES :-

##    ABOUT OUR IMPLEMENTATION :

### We have implemented knn algorithm with both built-in functions and user defined functions. Then we have compared accuracy of both models. Then we have found the importance of different features in determining/predicting diabetes in a person using decision tree and random forests. We have also used Logistic Regression to find out separation probabilities. Then at last on the basis of graph visualization we have found that some of the features are redundant and removed them and then again checked the accuracy of model which was found to be higher.
